# FAQ

## Getting Started

### What LLM providers are supported?
Any provider supported by OpenClaw: Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), Google (Gemini), local models via Ollama, and more.

### Do all agents need separate API keys?
No. All agents share the same OpenClaw configuration and API keys.

### Can I use this without Telegram?
Yes. OpenClaw supports Discord, Slack, Signal, WhatsApp, IRC, webchat, and more. Telegram is just one option. However, agent configs include Telegram notification calls — you may want to edit `AGENTS.md` files to match your messaging channel.

### How many agents can I run?
As many as your system handles. Each agent is a lightweight config — it doesn't consume resources when idle.

### Does this work on Linux/Windows?
OpenClaw runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (via WSL). Some scripts use macOS-specific `sed -i ''` syntax — on Linux, use `sed -i` without the empty quotes.

### The agent configs are in Russian. Can I use this in English?
Yes. Edit `SOUL.md` and `AGENTS.md` in each agent directory to change the language. The architecture and system logic are language-independent. Keep the technical parts (session keys, tool calls) as-is.

## Setup

### The setup script fails
1. Check that OpenClaw is installed: `openclaw --version`
2. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (need v20+)
3. Check permissions: `ls -la ~/.openclaw/agents/`

### I see `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` in agent messages
You have unfilled placeholders. Re-run the deploy script:
```bash
bash deploy-one-click.sh
```
Or find them manually:
```bash
grep -rn '{{[A-Z_]*}}' agents/ --include='*.md'
```

### An agent doesn't respond
1. Check gateway: `openclaw status`
2. Check agent files: `ls ~/.openclaw/agents/<name>/agent/`
3. Check that the agent config exists in `~/.openclaw/agents/<name>/openclaw.json`
4. Check logs for errors
5. If needed, restart the shared gateway from your shell: `openclaw gateway restart`

### Skills don't load
Skills must be in the agent's skills directory:
```bash
ls ~/.openclaw/agents/producer/agent/skills/
```
If empty, re-run `bash deploy-one-click.sh`.

### Telegram notifications don't work
1. Verify your Telegram user ID is set (digits only, get from @userinfobot)
2. Check that your bot token is configured in OpenClaw
3. Make sure you've started a chat with your bot first

### How do I know which `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` to fill?
The deploy script handles placeholders automatically. For the full list, see `.env.example` and run:
```bash
grep -rn '{{[A-Z_]*}}' . --include='*.md' | grep -v node_modules | sort -u -t: -k3
```

## Customization

### Can I change agent names?
Yes. Edit `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, and `AGENTS.md` in the agent's directory. The session key in `TOOLS.md` must match the OpenClaw agent name.

### Can I add agents from different shows?
Absolutely. The Breaking Bad theme is cosmetic. Agent behavior is defined by the config files, not the character names. See [examples/add-new-agent.md](../examples/add-new-agent.md).

### Can I remove agents I don't need?
Yes. Remove the agent directory and update `references/team-constitution.md` to remove references. The minimum viable team is Heisenberg (main) + one specialist.

### How do I share skills between agents?
Place skills in a shared directory and configure each agent to reference it, or copy skills to each agent's skills directory. See [skills/README.md](../skills/README.md) for the full skills index.

### What is the Board-First Protocol?
It's how agents coordinate. Instead of relying only on messages (which can timeout), the coordinator writes tasks to a file (`references/team-board.md` in a live workspace, usually created from `references/team-board.md.example`). Agents read this file to know their assignments. This survives crashes and session losses.

### Where do task results go?
Results are saved in `projects/<task-name>/` — briefing, intermediate files, and final output are all kept. Nothing is deleted.

## Costs

### How much does this cost to run?
Depends on your LLM usage. Idle agents cost nothing. Active usage depends on your provider's pricing and how many tasks you run. A typical task uses 1-3 API calls per agent involved.

### Can I use free/local models?
Yes. Configure Ollama or any local model provider in OpenClaw. Some skills may work better with larger models (Opus/GPT-4 for complex code, Sonnet/GPT-3.5 for simpler tasks).

## Architecture

### What happens if an agent crashes?
Each agent has a `BOOTSTRAP.md` with recovery instructions. The system uses file-based state (team board), so no work is lost. Restart the gateway and the agent picks up where it left off.

### Can agents work in parallel?
Yes. Saul (coordinator) can assign tasks to multiple agents simultaneously. Each agent runs in its own session.

### What are the 7 files in each agent directory?
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Role, responsibilities, delegation rules |
| `SOUL.md` | Personality, tone, communication style |
| `IDENTITY.md` | Name, boundaries, self-awareness |
| `TOOLS.md` | Available tools and API methods |
| `MEMORY.md` | Persistent knowledge and context |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | Recovery instructions after restart |
| `HEARTBEAT.md` | Periodic/scheduled tasks |

## OpenAI / Codex

### Can I use OpenAI Codex login instead of a normal API key?
Yes, if your OpenClaw build supports the `openai-codex` provider. Check available providers first:
```bash
openclaw models list
```
If `openai-codex` is available, authenticate that provider and select a model from the `openai-codex/...` family.

### Why does OpenClaw say `No API key found for provider "openai-codex"`?
Usually the model was switched, but the agent or workspace was not authenticated for that provider. Re-check auth and provider availability:
```bash
openclaw models list
openclaw status
```

### Does ChatGPT Plus automatically cover OpenAI API usage?
No. Standard OpenAI API billing is separate. If you want subscription-style auth, use the provider and login flow that your OpenClaw build exposes, such as `openai-codex`, not plain `openai`, when supported.

## Sandboxing / access

### Why can an agent not SSH into my server or access a project outside the workspace?
Usually this is not a server problem. It is the agent sandbox or permission policy. Safe default behavior is to work inside the current workspace and with limited network access.

Practical fix:
1. clone or copy the target project into the agent workspace
2. do the edits locally
3. deploy separately with the permissions you control

If you need direct server access, run the agent in an environment that explicitly allows it.
